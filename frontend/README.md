# Frontend Documentation for My Python React App

## Overview
This is the frontend part of the `pxs`, built using React. It serves as the user interface for the application, interacting with the backend API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will start the React application and open it in your default web browser.

### Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` folder containing the optimized application.

## Folder Structure
- `public/`: Contains static files, including `index.html`.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `App.js`: The main React component.
  - `index.js`: The entry point for the React application.
